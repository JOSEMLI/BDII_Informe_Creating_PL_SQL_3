	\subitem-\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:A program that computes and returns a single value
	\subitem-\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:Named PL/SQL blocks that are stored in the database and can be declared as procedures or functions
	\subitem-\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:Software that checks and translates programs written in highlevel programming languages into binary code to execute
	\subitem-\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:A program that performs an action, but does not have to return a value

	\subitem 02- Which of the following PL/SQL blocks executes successfully? For the blocks that fail, explain why they fail

	\subitem    END;
	\subitem B. DECLARE
 	\subitem    amount INTEGER(10);
	\subitem    END;
	\subitem C. DECLARE
	 \subitem   BEGIN
	 \subitem   END;
	\subitem D. DECLARE

	 \subitem	DBMS\_OUTPUT.PUT\_LINE(amount);
	 \subitem	END;
	
	\subitem 03- Fill in the blanks:
	\subitem A. PL/SQL blocks that have no names are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
	\subitem B. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are named blocks and are stored in the database
